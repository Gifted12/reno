 <h3>Hey Babe,</h3>
</div>
 <div class="third">
    <p>              So like for some days now I've been thinking of doing something different and special for you. I couldn't come up with anything yet tho, all what I was thinking of were outrageous and cost alot. But after I sent you that link about kisses the other day I started thinking of this final idea about doing something that involves you clicking a link and it all made sense cos you're a tech freak so I decided doing a romantic-tech-freak surprise for you. I hope you like it.</p>
 </div>
<div class="forth">
    <p>Let me even tell you about the other ideas that came to me, first I was like lemme write a letter and send to you through the post office postal service but when I reason the stress and everything I just fashi. Then there's another one again I can't really figure what it was tho but when I asked it costed about 100k and it'd take months and stuff omo there were a lot of stuff tho. Sorry I didn't tell you that I was coming to Abuja, na cos of rush rush and the other things I explained to you. Omo babe you need to see the beauty of this city in the night e go too nice for photo shoot, maybe one day we go just pay bolt wey go drive us go one better spot around Gwarimpa make we chill and take pictures. You'll have to bear with me boss ion know once I start writing for you I no go wan stop I'll just keep going and going till I na find out that it's too long already.</p>
</div>
<div class="fifth">
    <p>           As you can see so far I'm trying my possible best not to be too-sexual. I deserve a fvking accolade guy, clap for me. *plays One Woman by AG Baby Ft Ty Dollar Sign* This whole stuff came about when I was thinking; "What can I do for my baby that'll make her look and smile and say to herself omo I have the best boyfriend in the world". So yeah I just want you to know that you're always on my mind 24/7 when I say 24/7 I mean it. I love you babe. Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything but everything means nothing if I don't have you. Can't wait to see you.</p>
